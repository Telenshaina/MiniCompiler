# Mini Java Compiler - Lexical, Syntax, and Semantic Analysis  

Welcome to our **Mini Compiler Project**!  

This project is a lightweight Java-based compiler designed to demonstrate the three critical phases of compilation:  

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Breaking down the source code into meaningful tokens while validating their format.  
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Ensuring the code adheres to the rules of Java's syntax by validating token order and structure.  
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Verifying the semantic correctness of declarations, such as type compatibility between variables and their values.  

## Key Features  
- **Supports Multiple Lines**: Validates multiple Java variable declarations in a single run.  
- **Java Primitive Data Types**: Handles data types like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, and `String`.  
- **Flexible Input**: Works with or without spaces around operators like `=` and `;`.  
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provides clear feedback for missing semicolons, invalid identifiers, data type mismatches, and more.  

## Why This Project?  
This mini compiler showcases the foundational processes that power modern programming languages. Itâ€™s an educational tool, ideal for understanding how compilers work under the hood while focusing on these essential phases.  

## How It Works  
- The **Lexical Analyzer** tokenizes the input and checks for missing or invalid components.  
- The **Syntax Analyzer** ensures that tokens follow the correct Java syntax.  
- The **Semantic Analyzer** checks the compatibility of values with their data types.
